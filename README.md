Embedded AI on FPGA using High Level Synthesis :

The goal of the project is the full development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerated on a CPU / FPGA system using High Level Synthesis (HLS). HLS, also referred to as C synthesis, electronic system-level (ESL) synthesis, algorithmic synthesis or behavioral synthesis, is an automated design process that inputs a C / C++ like piece of code and outputs a hardware (RTL) accelerator in VHDL, Verilog or SystemC. The CNN we want to accelerate on FPGA using HLS is based on LeNet for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition and the FPGA target is a ZedBoard platform featuring a Zynq-7000 SoC (ARM dual core Cortex-A9 / Xilinx FPGA).
